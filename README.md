# accessible-pdfs

Demonstrations of producing accessible, PDF/A-4f and PDF/UA-2 -compliant
PDF documents using various LaTeX-related tool chains

## Environment info

Developed using Ubuntu 25.04.  Apt packages that likely need to be installed
include:

* texlive-full
* texlive-fonts-extra
* texlive-extra-utils
* pandoc

Additionally, `quarto` was installed using the [deb from their
website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

For the Jupyter notebook tool chain, jupyterlab 4.4.2 was installed within
a Python venv.


## Contributing

Contributions welcome!  Especially...

* A solution for the compliance failures on the Adobe "Lbl and LBody" item.
* Additional tool chains.  An Overleaf approach would probably help a lot of people.
* Additional LaTeX content features in the example documents.
