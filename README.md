## Contributing

Contributions welcome!  Especially...

* A solution for the compliance failures on the Adobe "Lbl and LBody" item.
* Additional tool chains.  An Overleaf approach would probably help a lot of people.
* Additional LaTeX content features in the example documents.
* Working environments for OSX and Windows
